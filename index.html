                3 Steps to a Healthier You
            </h2>
            <p>
                Healthy living begins with healthy and well-prepared groceries. If you plan in advance what you want to buy using our health-conscious grocery list template, your diet should run successfully. 
            </p>

                    Change Your Shopping Habits
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make a shopping list and stick to it to resist unhealthy impulse buys and buy only the product you actually need. This means you’ll be less likely to end up with products that you’ll never use, or worse, have to throw away.

                    Go for Healthier Substitutes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of what makes up a healthy grocery list is substituting what you already have on your grocery list for a better alternative. One of the simplest changes to make is to switch your usual carbs for wholemeal or wholegrain alternatives. You should also stay away from red and processed meat and include more oily fish on the list. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="steps__wrap pt-small">

                    Enjoy Positive Impact on the Environment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remember that sticking to a healthy grocery list will help you create less demand for meat and reduce your negative impact on the environment. After all, food waste is a large contributor to greenhouse gasses and climate change.

                <h3>
                    Is it possible to make a healthy grocery list on a budget?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, but it will take a little more effort. If you’re on a budget, you might want to consider: 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Buying fresh fruit and vegetables instead of frozen.</li>
                    <li>Buying dried legumes instead of tinned.</li>
                    <li>Making your own alternatives at home, suach as almond milk.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>
                    Fresh or Frozen Fruit and Veg?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Fresh fruit and vegetables are always the healthiest options, right? 
Generally, the answer is yes. However, research shows that frozen fruit and veg 
lose little to none of their nutrients compared to their fresh counterparts. 
Giving fresh produce a very cold shoulder by going frozen will not make an indent on your health.

                <p>
                    We realize that some low-fat substitutes don’t taste very good. 
If you really don’t like a low-fat alternative, then stick to your regular kind.
Just make sure you’re making enough adjustments elsewhere on your healthy grocery list to offset the changes.
